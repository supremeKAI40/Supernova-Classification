# Supernova-Classification
A Machine Learning Model to Classfify Supernova from Observed Data and Nuclear Signatures
Thermonuclear supernovae (Type-Ia or SNeIa) are deeply connected to topics
throughout astrophysics and cosmology. However, we are yet to understand complete physics of these supernovae
With this ML Model, I aim to help in the understanding of these Astrophysical objects with help of my skills.
<br><br> 
Here I employ both Linear Models using Pytorch and Classification Models from SciKit Learn. 
I have treated the prediction of physical paramters as Regression Problem, although for simulated data, we can treat them as Classification Problem too.

Parameters Predicted:<br>
<br>Physical Calculated Parameters<br>
Total Mass: MSELoss: 0.4506514 <br>
Nickel Mass: MSELoss: 0.0494148<br>
Explosion Energy: MSELoss: 1.070089<br>
<br>Initial Parameters of Simulation<br>
Initial Mass Distribution: Accuracy: 0.73 <br>
Initial Nickel Radial Distribution: Accuracy: 0.85 <br>

A further probe can be undertaken in the use of Deep Learning Models to better identify relations. Perhaps use of Boosting Algorithms can also be investigated.
